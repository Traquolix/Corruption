/**
 * The {@code Reforge} interface serves as a marker interface for reforges in the
 * {@code fr.traquolix.items.modifications.reforges} package.
 *
 * <p>Marker interfaces are interfaces that do not declare any methods and are used to categorize
 * classes or add metadata to them without providing any specific functionality.</p>
 *
 * <p>In this case, the {@code Reforge} interface is used to categorize classes that represent different
 * reforges, such as {@code WeaponReforge} and {@code ArmorReforge}. It allows the program to identify and
 * group these classes as reforges, making it easier to work with them in certain contexts.</p>
 *
 * <p>The interface is currently empty, but it can be extended later if there is a need to add common
 * functionality or methods specific to reforges. For now, it serves its purpose as a marker interface to
 * categorize and distinguish reforges from other classes in the package.</p>
